DESCRIPTION: EduThrive: A Dark-Themed E-Learning Platform with a Modern Touch ðŸŒ™ðŸŽ“
EduThrive is a beautifully designed e-learning platform that provides users with a seamless and engaging learning experience. The styling of the platform plays a crucial role in making it user-friendly, visually appealing, and easy to navigate. The CSS file ensures a dark-themed aesthetic, enhancing readability while reducing eye strain. This design choice is particularly effective for learners who spend extended hours engaging with the platform.

Dark Mode for a Sleek and Comfortable Experience ðŸ–¤
The primary theme of EduThrive is dark mode, which is known for being easy on the eyes, reducing glare, and improving focus. The background color is set to #121212 (a dark gray shade), ensuring a smooth and professional look. White text (color: white;) is used for better contrast, making content easily readable.

Course Cards: A Visually Appealing Learning Hub ðŸ“š
The course section is one of the most critical parts of EduThrive. The courses are displayed using visually appealing course cards, each with a title, description, and buttons for enrollment. The .course-card class ensures that each course is displayed in a neat and structured manner, using a dark background with rounded corners and soft shadows to give it an elegant look.
